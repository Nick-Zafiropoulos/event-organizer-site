## About

This repo contains the code for the Event Organizer information website. Event Organizer is a scheduler for Discord that allows a user to poll other users for their availability and automatically creates events based on the result of the poll.

The website is still under construction and therefore is not a completed project as of yet, please check back for updates as aspects of the website are completed and the site goes live.
